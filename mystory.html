<h2><u>My story</u></h2>
<h3><i>Chalew Deghebo</i></h3>

<h4>This is my developer story.</h4>

<br>
<ul>
  <li> As a child, there was no computer or even cell-phone in the family.
  </li>
  <br>
  <li>
    In the high School, we had few computers for Computer Lab class for the
    whole school, and I had only two Lab classes the whole school year to
    learn; <br> turning-on and off a PC, how to search on an Internet
    Explorer, how
    to use Microsoft word and excel, and saving files.
  </li>
  <br>
  <li>
    In the college, I had a better access to computers at the college's
    library
    where I used to use computers to gather more information when I had
    assignments.
  </li>
  <br>
  <li>
    After I had arrived in the USA, I had better access to the Internet and
    computers in the Public library.
  </li>
  <br>
  <li>I always had an interest and love for technology. <br>
    The first P.C I bought was called called Toshiba-Satellite.
  </li>
  <br>
  <li>Currently, I joined Refcode community with the <em>2022-Spring-cohort
      training</em> to learn more
    about Software Engineering where my dream is always being a Software
    Engineer.
  </li>
</ul>
